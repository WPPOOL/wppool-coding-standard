# WPCS 33 Git Action

To test projects with WPCS 3 automatically when pushed to master or develop, you need to place the `wpcs.yml` to `.github/workflows/wpcs.yml` in your root directory.


Example:
`wp-dark-mode/.github/workflows/wpcs.yml`


Remember: Place the file in your development directory to avoid conflicts.
